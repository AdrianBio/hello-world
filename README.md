# hello-world
I wonder when I'll visit this repository again. May my journey with coding begin.

Is there anybody out there?

We lost many things during this 2020 Pandemic. I won't get into details but I am sure that anybody who's currently living through this will have their own story to tell. One thing I will say is that I made it a priority not to come out of this without a new skill. Coding is that skill. My brother is a Senior Software Engineer at Apple Inc., so there's always been talk of programming and computers around my house. But I have little hands-on experience. I always regretted not starting earlier in my career. But here I am. Amongst the many languages that exist out there, I have chosen R. Mainly because I have some familiarity with it from a statistics and probability course during undergrad. More, I think it'll be a fantastic and powerful adjunct to my current laboratory and experimental skills. Hopefully in the near future I will be able to carry out projects and analyses using R to complement my laboratory work. 

Well, here I go.
